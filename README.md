# Street Fighter II Clone

A basic clone of Street Fighter II written in Python

## Description

This Python project uses the pygame library to recreate the basic features of the Street Fighter II game on a computer, namely the fighting aspect with Ryu and Ken. There will be more features added to this project such as local multiplayer and more characters (see Upcoming Features).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed
2. Clone the repo
